## Dashboard Analysis

1. **Age and Gender**

* Recent data shows the most active bikers are those born in 1969. This population is approximately 51 years old. 
* However, when we look at age ranges, we see the largest biker group are those born in the 1990's, from 1990-1999. This is followed by those born in the 1980's, making the leading age group in their 30's. 
* The gender taking the most trips on Citibike are males, making up about 46.8MM riders. Women make up slightly more than half, at 24.2MM. 
* However, women take slightly longer rides than those of men. Notably, the majority of people who did not select a gender, have taken the longest rides. 

2. **Subscriber v. Customer**

* More than half of CitiBike users, 55.4%, have subscriptions with the company. However, this is not significantly different than those that are just customers of Citibike year round, which make up 44.6% of users. 
* Unsurprisingly, the people who are subcribers of Citibike, ride Citibikes the longest.
* Similar to the gender breakdown, the largest group to ride bikes are subscribed-males. This is followed by those that are female subscribers of Citibike.


## Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
